An Android todo list with automatic sorting based on the urgent-important matrix.
Written in JavaScript with React Native.


TODO:
- convert items to using a date for importance instead of a boolean
- notifications
- make everything pretty
- figure out why elevation property (material shadows) aren't working
- improve animations (use Animated API instead of LayoutAnimation)
