An Android todo list with automatic sorting based on the urgent-important matrix.
Written in JavaScript with React Native.


TODO:
- convert items to using a date for importance instead of a boolean
- list section styling and animations (will probably require major changes to ```home/TodoList```)
- data saving
- notifications
- make everything pretty
